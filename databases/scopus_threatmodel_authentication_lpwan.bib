abstract={Recently, many Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) protocols have been proposed for securing resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices with negligible power consump-tion. The Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a low power communication protocol that supports message authentication, integrity, and encryption using two-session preshared secret keys. However, although the LoRaWAN supports some security functions, it suffers from session key generation and key update problems. This motivates us to introduce a new key management protocol that resolves the LoRaWAN problems and supports key updates. The proposed protocol is based on hash chain generation using a one-way hash function. Network entities share a common hash chain of n key elements to allow using a unique signing key per message. We also propose a salt hashing algorithm that encrypts the original keys into a different form to avoid the physical attacks at the end device side. We analyzed the proposed key generation performance in terms of the computation time, the required storage, and the communication overhead. We implemented and tested the proposed key generation protocol using the NS-3 network simulator. The proposed lightweight key generation protocol significantly enhances the security of the original LoRaWAN at a negligible overhead. The proposed protocol reduces the power consumption and transmission time by two times compared with some previous protocols. In addition, the proposed key generation protocol can resist attacks, such as key compromising attacks and replay attacks, and it supports the Perfect Forward Secrecy, which was not supported by LoRaWAN. © 2021 by the authors.

abstract={With the provision of rapid advancement in smart devices used in various technological fields exponentially increases the heterogeneity and energy consumption in internet of things (IoT). The technological leap in information and communication technology instigates the heterogeneity in smart devices, frameworks, architectures, communication technologies, and various industrial and nonindustrial applications. Therefore, a detailed taxonomy of IoT is proposed covering the diverse aspect of IoT lacking interoperability and energy efficiency. Existing research lacks the root causes of heterogeneity and energy consumption at the industrial and technological level. Keeping this in view, our research identified industrial integration and technological challenges. Moreover, we explore the effect on IoT devices when different types of energy harvesters are connected with IoT devices. Our comprehensive research addresses the various issues such as resource management, fog data analytics, energy consumption, heterogeneity, scalability, and the role of quality of service, data science, machine learning to accomplish interoperability and energy efficiency in IoT. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

abstract={Advanced persistent threat (APT), with intense penetration, long duration, and high customization, has become one of the most grievous threats to cybersecurity. Furthermore, the design and development of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices often do not focus on security, leading APT to extend to IoT, such as the Internet of emerging unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Whether malware with attack payload can be successfully implanted into UAVs or not is the key to APT on the Internet of UAVs. APT malware on UAVs establishes communication with the command and control (CC) server to achieve remote control for UAVs-aware information stealing. Existing effective methods detect malware by analyzing malicious behaviors generated during CC communication. However, APT malware usually adopts a low-traffic attack mode, a large amount of normal traffic is mixed in each attack step, to avoid virus checking and killing. Therefore, it is difficult for traditional malware detection methods to discover APT malware on UAVs that carry weak abnormal signals. Fortunately, we found that most APT attacks use domain name system (DNS) to locate CC server of malware for information transmission periodically. This behavior will leave some records in the network flow and DNS logs, which provides us with an opportunity to identify infected internal UAVs and external malicious domain names. This article proposes an APT malware on the Internet of UAVs detection method combining string matching and Fourier transformation based on DNS traffic, which is able to handle encrypted and obfuscated traffic due to packet payloads independence. We preprocessed the collected network traffic by converting DNS timestamps of DNS request to strings and used the trained random forest model to discover APT malware domain names based on features extracted through string-matching-based periodicity detection and Fourier transformation-based periodicity detection. The proposed method has been evaluated on the data set, including part of normal domains from the normal traffic and malicious domains marked by security experts from APT malware traffic. Experimental results have shown that our proposed detection method can achieve the accuracy of 94%, which is better than the periodicity detection algorithm alone. Moreover, the proposed method does not need to set the confidence to filter the periodicity with high confidence. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={D2D communication is an integral part of LTE-Advance and 5G cellular networks, has gained a lot of popularity in recent years as it offers high speed, extended coverage, and ubiquitous connectivity. Besides basic function that is direct communication without the need of Base Station (BS), D2D allows small communicating device to act as intermediate device not only for forward the traffics but also permits the sharing of resources such as spectrum, services, data and social contents for any users that are near the proximity range. With the provision of devices to provide such services and act as authorization devices give rise to vulnerabilities in terms of security and trust, therefore secure mutual authentication is mandatory to mitigate any security threats. In this paper, certificateless trust based lightweight security scheme (TLWS) for D2D multihop communication is proposed. This proposed scheme utilized elliptic curve and Elgamal cryptosystem assisted with secure hashing algorithm, timestamps, and blindfold challenge for secure communication and key agreements. In addition, we prove that TLWS provides secure mutual authentication using the broadly accepted Burrows–Abadi–Needham logic and shows that the proposed scheme is protected against replay attacks and Man in the middle attack. Overall, TLWS offers better security and functionality features, and the communicationandcomputationaloverheadsarecomparablewiththerelatedschemes.Therefore, TLWS is applicable to mobile environment efficiently. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The edge-based Internet of Things (IoT) computing provides a new value for the consumer where the smart devices, objects, and appliances connected over the internet. The data generated from the smart IoT devices need to be securely processed. With the increasing rate of smart IoT devices, the existing addressing schemes and security protocols do not guaranty to perform well in all situations. This paper proposed a smart card based secure addressing and authentication (SCSAA) scheme by modifying the standard IPv6 protocol to mitigate the security threats in the IoT network. The proposed scheme has two folds; firstly, this scheme provides a unique way of addressing by assigning unique 64-bit interface identifier (IID) to smart devices/appliances and uniquely authenticates them in IoT network. Secondly, this scheme uses the secret session key to prevent the network from unauthorized access. Additionally, this work also evaluates the informal security analysis, formal security analysis using ROR model and AVISPA tool. The overall security analysis proves that proposed scheme protect the smart home IoT network from various vulnerabilities and attacks. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The IoT is the upcoming one of the major networking technologies. Using the IoT, different items or devices can be allowed to continuously generate, obtain, and exchange information. Different IoT applications nowadays are centered on computerizing various errands and are attempting to engage the inanimate physical items to act without direct supervision of a human. The current and forthcoming IoT services are exceptionally encouraging to build the degree of solace, proficiency, and automation for the clients. To obtain the option to actualize such a world in a continuously developing manner requires high security, protection, verification, and recuperation from assaults. Right now, incorporating the requisite changes in IoT systems engineering to achieve end-to-end, stable IoT infrastructure is paramount. In this research, a comprehensive analysis is incorporated into the security-relevant problems and threat wellsprings in IoT resources or applications. Specific that and current advancements based on maintaining a high degree of confidence in IoT apps are addressed while looking at the security issues. Four distinct developments are investigated, including cryptography, fog computing, edge computing, and ML (Machine Learning), to extend the degree of IoT security. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The number of unoccupied aerial systems (UAS) is projected to exponentially increase in the next few decades for a variety of civil and military uses. However, this poses significant challenges with respect to airspace integration. This paper reviews identified security vulnerabilities of the two main options for UAS communication and airspace management, aircraft communications addressing and reporting system (ACARS) and automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B). Based on a comprehensive threat model, open questions and challenges to secure communication of UAS are discussed. As the state of the art is unable to apply security functionalities, this paper presents the safety and security for UAS (S2UAS) system architecture. This novel approach incorporates relevant safety and security aspects for UAS operation, while taking the aforementioned challenges into account. S2UAS covers four essential aspects: (1) detect incoming aerospace vehicles, (2) authenticate those vehicles and establish a secure communication channel, (3) safely react to failed authentication and (4) enable collaboration such as formation flight, even if vehicles are only partially trustworthy. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={LoRaWAN (Low-power Wide-Area Networks) is the main specification for application-level IoT (Internet of Things). The current version, published in October 2017, is LoRaWAN 1.1, with its 1.0 precursor still being the main specification supported by commercial devices such as PyCom LoRa transceivers. Prior (semi)-formal investigations into the security of the LoRaWAN protocols are scarce, especially for Lo-RaWAN 1.1. Moreover, amongst these few, the current encodings [4], [9] of LoRaWAN into verification tools unfortunately rely on much-simplified versions of the LoRaWAN protocols, undermining the relevance of the results in practice. In this paper, we fill in some of these gaps. Whilst we briefly discuss the most recent cryptographic-orientated works [5] that looked at LoRaWAN 1.1, our true focus is on producing formal analyses of the security and correctness of LoRaWAN, mechanised inside automated tools. To this end, we use the state-of-The-Art prover, Tamarin. Importantly, our Tamarin models are a faithful and precise rendering of the LoRaWAN specifications. For example, we model the bespoke nonce-generation mechanisms newly introduced in LoRaWAN 1.1, as well as the 'classical' but shortdomain nonces in LoRaWAN 1.0 and make recommendations regarding these. Whilst we include small parts on device-commissioning and application-level traffic, we primarily scrutinise the Join Procedure of LoRaWAN, and focus on version 1.1 of the specification, but also include an analysis of Lo-RaWAN 1.0. To this end, we consider three increasingly strong threat models, resting on a Dolev-Yao attacker acting modulo different requirements made on various channels (e.g., secure/insecure) and the level of trust placed on entities (e.g., honest/corruptible network servers). Importantly, one of these threat models is exactly in line with the LoRaWAN specification, yet it unfortunately still leads to attacks. In response to the exhibited attacks, we propose a minimal patch of the LoRaWAN 1.1 Join Procedure, which is as backwards-compatible as possible with the current version. We analyse and prove this patch secure in the strongest threat model mentioned above. This work has been responsibly disclosed to the LoRa Alliance, and we are liaising with the Security Working Group of the LoRa Alliance, in order to improve the clarity of the LoRaWAN 1.1 specifications in light of our findings, but also by using formal analysis as part of a feedback-loop of future and current specification writing. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={With 6G flagship program launched by the University of Oulu, Finland, for full future adaptation of 6G by 2030, many institutes worldwide have started to explore various issues and challenges in 6G communication networks. 6G offers ultra high-reliable and massive ultra-low latency while opening the doors for many applications currently not viable by today's 4G and 5G communication standards. The current 5G technology has security and privacy issues which makes its usage in limited applications. In such an environment, we believe that AI can offer efficient solutions for the aforementioned issues having low communication overhead cost. Keeping focus on all these issues, in this paper, we presented a comprehensive survey on AI-enabled 6G communication technology, which can be used in wide range of future applications. In this article, we explore how AI can be integrated into different applications such as object localization, UAV communication, surveillance, security and privacy preservation etc. Finally, we discussed a use case that shows the adoption of AI techniques in intelligent transport system. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The potent concept of fog computing is currently attracting many researchers as it brings cloud services closer to the end-user. It also roots out some of the major limitations of the cloud scenario where there exists the need for extremely low latency. Despite its compelling advantages, fog computing is still an evolving paradigm that demands further research. Among all the other issues prevalent in fog computing, security is one of the burning issues. Fog nodes, being at the edge of the network, pose several security threats. The authors have thus conducted a systematic literature review (SLR) on security issues in fog computing scenario. Initially, the prevalent security issues are identified through an in-depth survey and then the available literature per security issue is analyzed systematically. This SLR reveals that the security in/through fog scenario is being addressed by the researchers all over the globe. But, the approaches with respect to fog environment still lack methods to evaluate security aspects. Though most of the researchers are prioritizing the consideration of security aspects at fog level, there still exists a need to consider fog computing security as an area of serious concern. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={With the deployment of more and more 5g networks, the limitations of 5g networks have been found, which undoubtedly promotes the exploratory research of 6G networks as the next generation solutions. These investigations include the fundamental security and privacy problems associated with 6G technologies. Therefore, in order to consolidate and solidify this foundational research as a basis for future investigations, we have prepared a survey on the status quo of 6G security and privacy. The survey begins with a historical review of previous networking technologies and how they have informed the current trends in 6G networking. We then discuss four key aspects of 6G networks – real-time intelligent edge computing, distributed artificial intelligence, intelligent radio, and 3D intercoms – and some promising emerging technologies in each area, along with the relevant security and privacy issues. The survey concludes with a report on the potential use of 6G. Some of the references used in this paper along and further details of several points raised can be found at: security-privacyin5g-6g.github.io. © 2020 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

abstract={Health is wealth. Thus, it is very important to keep it healthy all the time for sustenance of human livelihood. Last decade has witnessed a number of digital developments, including sensors, microcontrollers, communication paradigm, and smarter societal need. Internet of Things (IoT) has pushed the human race toward harnessing of truly digitized e-healthcare services mainly by relying over the biosensors. Biosensors play most crucial role in IoT when question of e-healthcare comes into the scene. A range of sensors are available in market that help people to monitor daily fitness, blood glucose level and many smart home-based diagnostics. However, lack of proper categorization of such sensors has led to create problems like delay in government approval, gap in patient–doctor​ relationship, increased social inertia toward using the sensors in accordance to regular life style. To mitigate these issues, this work presents a systematic review on existing IoT-based sensors and IoT-market cap originated sensor-systems for taxonomically representation. We present comparative analysis among the reviewed sensors. We further present security and privacy issues associated with the sensor data and ways to mitigate them. We also discuss about futuristic plans to enhance current scenario. We further elaborate on how such intervention could be beneficial or problematic for society. We can conclude that IoT-based sensors upon certain fixation in terms of categorization and proper orientation can be very useful to make a smarter human society. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Privacy issues in Cloud Computing are one of the major concerns for many individuals and companies around the world, and still a challenge for research and industry. The appearance of the 5G technology and the latest advances in Mobile Cloud Computing gave way to fog-enabled systems that represent the future of current cloud systems. Accordingly, the Fog concept had been proposed in 2013 to enhance the IoT-Cloud operations in terms of latency and reliability. In this paper we analyze and categorize surveys addressing privacy issues of these complex systems, and propose PFMCC, a model for preserving Privacy in Fog-enabled Mobile Cloud Computing systems using 5G connection. The PFMCC model consists of three components interacting with each other to preserve data privacy, usage privacy, location privacy and high mobility. We also present three algorithms to perform privacy-aware computation offloading to the fog. © 2020 IEEE.},

abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) devices currently rely on centralized, brokered communication models which call for a number of security flaws and threats. Privacy security remain a challenge owing to the existing systems being centralized - creating a single point of failure. In this paper, we lay out an architecture for incorporating a concept similar to Blockchain - the technology that underpins the cryptocurrency Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies to provide decentralized security and privacy for IoT devices. Currently, the issue with most IoT devices is that they lack the processing power, storage and computational overhead to run consensus algorithms to be an active part of the Blockchain network. The current issue with the blockchain on the other hand, is its low scalability and low number of transactions per second. We present an innovative approach using a technology called IOTA. This addresses some of the most important problems with existing blockchain infrastructure such as being able to run on lightweight devices with constrained memory. We eliminate transaction fees and the concept of mining which requires a large amount of processing power to compete with other miners. IOTA's main component is the Tangle, a guided acyclic graph (DAG) for transaction storage. We discuss creation of two IoT applications on the tangle - a smart utility meter system and a smart car transaction system which are connected to internet through Low Power Wide Area IoT networks. © 2019 IEEE.},
